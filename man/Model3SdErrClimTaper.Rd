\title{Three-sigma error specification assuming errors are smaller near
climatological median (or other quantile).}
\usage{
Model3SdErrClimTaper(data, qntlIncpt = 0.05, qntlClim = 0.5,
  pctErr = 0.15)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric The values for which errors are to be modeled.}

\item{qntlIncpt}{Numeric The quantile of historical observations to be used
as minimum error or intercept.}

\item{qntlClim}{Numeric The quantile of historical observations to be used as
observation value of minimum error.}

\item{pctErr}{Numeric The percent error associated with the observations.}
}
\description{
\code{Model3SdErrClimTaper} models three-sigma errors (same units as input)
as smallest (\code{qntlIncpt} intercept is some climatological quantile) at 
"climatological" observations (\code{qntlClim}, e.g. median = .5) and grow to
some maximum percent error (\code{pctErr}). This is expressed by \cr
\code{quantile(data, qntlIncpt) + pmin( pctErr*data,
pctErr*abs(data-quantile(data, qntlClim)) )}
}
