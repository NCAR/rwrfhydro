\title{Read the daily GHCN-D metadata and select gauges based on the user criteria.}
\usage{
SelectGhcnGauges(countryCode = NULL, networkCode = NULL, states = NULL,
  domain = FALSE, minLat = NULL, maxLat = NULL, minLon = NULL,
  maxLon = NULL, fileAdd = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{countryCode}{A vector of desired countries, e.g., 
countryCode=c("US","UK").}

\item{networkCode}{A vector of desired network types, e.g., for COOP and 
CoCoRaHS use networkCode=c("C","1").}

\item{states}{A vector of desired states if country is US, e.g., 
states=c("OK","TX").}

\item{domain}{Logical. Set to TRUE if you want to cut over a rectangle 
domain. (DEFAULT=FALSE)}

\item{minLat, maxLat, minLon, maxLon}{Numerics defining the boundary of the 
rectangle if domain=TRUE.}

\item{fileAdd}{Provide the address to the daily GHCN ghcnd-states.txt. 
Default is 
"ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-stations.txt".}
}
\value{
A dataframe of the selected gauges based on the user's criteria 
  containing the following fields: country, network type, stationID, lat/lon,
  elevation, state, description, GSN flag, HCN/CRN flag, WMO ID and 
  siteIds=[country,ntework,stationID]
}
\description{
\code{SelectGhcnGauges} is designed to create a dataframe of the selected 
gauges based on the user's criteria. The dataframe stores important 
information about each gauge such as country, network type, stationID, 
lat/lon, elevation, state, description, GSN flag, HCN/CRN flag, WMO ID and 
siteIds=[country,ntework,stationID]
}
\section{Selection criteria }{
 Selection can be based on the following 
  criteria: \enumerate{ \item A list of countries. For the full list of 
  countries refer to 
  \url{http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-countries.txt}, 
  example: countryCode=c("US","UK")
  
  \item A list of states (in this case the country will be automatically set 
  to US). For the full list of states refer to 
  \url{http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-states.txt}, 
  example: states=c("OK","TX")
  
  \item A specific type of the network. For a list of network codes, please 
  refer to \url{http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/readme.txt} The
  options are as follows: \itemize{ \item  0 = unspecified (station 
  identified by up to eight alphanumeric characters) \item  1 = Community 
  Collaborative Rain, Hail,and Snow (CoCoRaHS) based identification number. 
  To ensure consistency with GHCN Daily, all numbers in the original CoCoRaHS
  IDs have been left-filled to make them all four digits long. In addition, 
  the characters "-" and "_" have been removed to ensure that the IDs do not 
  exceed 11 characters when preceded by "US1". For example, the CoCoRaHS ID 
  "AZ-MR-156" becomes "US1AZMR0156" in GHCN-Daily \item  C = U.S. Cooperative
  Network identification number (last six characters of the GHCN-Daily ID) 
  \item  E = Identification number used in the ECA&D non-blended dataset 
  \item  M = World Meteorological Organization ID (last five characters of 
  the GHCN-Daily ID) \item  N = Identification number used in data supplied 
  by a National Meteorological or Hydrological Center \item R = U.S. 
  Interagency Remote Automatic Weather Station (RAWS) identifier \item S = 
  U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service SNOwpack TELemtry (SNOTEL) 
  station identifier \item  W = WBAN identification number (last five 
  characters of the GHCN-Daily ID) \item example: networkCode=c("C","1") } 
  \item Based on a domain. If domain is true, then you need min and max 
  latitude and logitude for the enclosing rectangle. }
