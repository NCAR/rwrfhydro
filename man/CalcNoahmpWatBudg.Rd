\title{Calculate water balance from WRF-Hydro (w/NoahMP) output}
\usage{
CalcNoahmpWatBudg(ldasoutDf, rtoutDf = NULL, gwoutDf = NULL,
  sfcrt = FALSE, soildeps = c(100, 300, 600, 1000), basarea = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ldasoutDf}{The LDASOUT dataframe (required)}

\item{rtoutDf}{The RTOUT dataframe, if overland or subsurface routing was 
turned on (default=NULL)}

\item{gwoutDf}{The GW_OUT dataframe, if groundwater model was turned on 
(default=NULL)}

\item{sfcrt}{A flag whether surface overland flow routing was active. All 
other routing options are determined based on the input dataframes, as 
needed (e.g., if gwoutDf is provided, it is assumed that the groundwater 
model was active). (default=FALSE)}

\item{soildeps}{A list of soil layer depths in mm (top to bottom, 
default=c(100, 300, 600, 1000))}

\item{basarea}{The basin area in square km (necessary only if gwoutDf is 
provided)}
}
\value{
A new dataframe containing the water budget components in mm.
}
\description{
\code{CalcNoahmpWatBudg} calculates water budget components from WRF-Hydro 
(w/NoahMP) model output.
}
\details{
\code{CalcNoahmpWatBudg} reads dataframes derived from WRF-Hydro output 
(i.e., using \code{\link{GetMultiNcdf}}) and calculates water budget 
partitioning (e.g., surface runoff, evaporation, groundwater). Assumes 
WRF-Hydro output dataframes have already been masked to the desired basin. 
See \code{\link{GetMultiNcdf}} documentation for examples of how to do this. 
NOTE: Currently only works for model runs using NoahMP as the LSM.

REQUIRED variables (these terms must be in your input dataframes): \itemize{ 
\item LDASOUT: ACCPRCP, ACCECAN, ACCETRAN, ACCEDIR, SFCRNOFF, UGDRNOFF, 
SOIL_M (all layers), SNEQV, CANICE, CANLIQ \item RTOUT (optional, use if 
overland or subsurface routing were activated): QSTRMVOLRT, SFCHEADSUBRT, 
QBDRY \item GWOUT (optional, use if groundwater bucket model was activated): 
q_cms, POSIXct }

OUTPUT water budget terms (may vary depending on model configuration): 
\itemize{ \item LSM_PRCP: Total precipitation (mm) \item LSM_ECAN: Total 
canopy evaporation (mm) \item LSM_ETRAN: Total transpiration (mm) \item 
LSM_EDIR: Total surface evaporation (mm) \item LSM_DELSWE: Change in snowpack
snow water equivalent (mm) \item LSM_DELCANWAT: Change in canopy water 
storage (liquid + ice) (mm) \item LSM_SFCRNOFF: Surface runoff from LSM 
\emph{(for an LSM-only run)} (mm) \item LSM_UGDRNOFF: Subsurface runoff from 
LSM \emph{(for an LSM-only run)} (mm) \item LSM_DELSOILM: Change in total 
soil moisture storage (mm) \item HYD_QSTRMVOL: Total runoff into channel from
land \emph{(routing model only)}  (mm) \item HYD_DELSFCHEAD: Change in 
surface storage \emph{(routing model only)} (mm) \item HYD_QBDRY: Total flow 
outside of domain \emph{(routing model only)} (mm) \item HYD_GWOUT: Total 
groundwater outflow \emph{(routing model only)} (mm) \item 
WB_SFCRNOFF: Total surface runoff used in the water budget calculation 
(\emph{either} LSM_SFCRNOFF or HYD_QSTRMVOL) (mm) \item WB_GWOUT: Total 
groundwater outflow used in the water budget calculation (\emph{either} 
LSM_UGDRNOFF or HYD_GWOUT) (mm) \item WB_DELGWSTOR: Change in groundwater 
storage (adjusted by surface runoff when no surface routing active) (mm) 
\item ERROR: Remainder in water budget (mm) 
\item RUN_FRAC: Runoff fraction, runoff/precipitation \item EVAP_FRAC: 
Evaporative fraction, evapotranspiration/precipitation \item STOR_FRAC: 
Change in storage fraction, storagechange/precipitation }
}
