\title{Plot water balance from WRF-Hydro (w/NoahMP) output}
\usage{
PlotWatBudg(wbDf, plottyp = "pie")
}
\arguments{
\item{wbDf}{The water budget dataframe (required)}

\item{plottyp}{The plot type (pie or bar) (default=pie)}
}
\value{
A plot of the water budget components in mm.
}
\description{
\code{PlotWatBudg} plot water budget components from WRF-Hydro (w/NoahMP)
model output.
}
\details{
Read water budget dataframe (as generated from
\code{\link{CalcNoahmpWatBudg}}) and plot water budget components as a
piechart or barchart. NOTE: Currently only works for runs using NoahMP as the
LSM.
}
\examples{
## Plot the water budget components from a water budget dataframe generated 
## using CalcNoahmpWatBudg. Plot as a piechart.

\dontrun{
PlotWatBudg(wb.allrt.fc)

## Plot the same as a barchart.

PlotWatBudg(wb.allrt.fc, "bar")
}
