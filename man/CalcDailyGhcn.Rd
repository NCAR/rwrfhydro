\title{Aggregate hourly precipitation data into daily values to be
comparable to GHCN daily data.}
\usage{
CalcDailyGhcn(sg, prcp, reportTime = 700, parallel = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sg}{A dataframe of the selectedGauges, it should have a column called siteIds,
which refer to the name of the station. 
siteIds should match the the standardized GHCN IDs (for example : ACW00011604).
See \url{http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-stations.txt}
for a list of siteIds.
It also should have a timeZone column or if not available it should have latitude 
and longitude which will be used whithin the function to find the timeZone.}

\item{prcp}{A dataframe of hourly data. It should have at least three columns:
POSIXct, statArg, and DEL_ACCPRCP. POSIXct has the time in UTC, statArg has the 
site ID, and DEL_ACCPRCP is the depth of rainfall for that hour. The DEL_ACCPRCP  
column will be with the same name if you use GetMultiNcdf, ReshapeMultiNcdf and
CalcNoahmpFluxes to get the precipitation from WRF-Hydro output files. 
Otherwise, rename the your datafram accordingly to have POSIXct, DEL_ACCPRCP and statArg.}

\item{reportTime}{A vector of reportTime matching with sg$siteIds. 
reportTime is a unique reporting time for each elelment of each gauge.
It may vary for different elements for a single gauge. 
The report time values are retrived when reading the daily GHCN data 
using  \code{GetGhcn2}. Note, use 700 wherever the report time is missing. 
It will be overwritten if sg$reportTime exits.}

\item{parallel}{Logical (DEFAULT=FALSE)}
}
\value{
A dataframe having 4 columns, the Daily precipitation comparable with daily GHCN data.
}
\description{
This function inputs the hourly forcing / model output data and aggregate then to daily.
GHCN gauges report data usually at 7:00 AM, 
however, that is not the case for all gauges. The reporting time may 
even differ for the same gauge but different elements. One can obtain the 
report time using \code{GetGhcn2}.
